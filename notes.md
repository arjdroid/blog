Saving State so that I might pick up on this later again.

this site should be staging area for how I want to shape arjdroid.me to be like.

everything should have a subdomain, like blog.nxtdroid.win, or santiago.nxtdroid.win, or typcraft.nxtdroid.win or chalybeate.nxtdroid.win

the main page should be an about page.

I should probably start things out simple, no static site generation overhead.

I am curious whether - in furtherance of making the site look aesthetically pleasing – I can get away with only CSS styles and little or preferably no JavaScript whatsoever.

Just plain HTML + CSS. It's been a while, but stuff has come a long way.

Then I may be able to inscribe those rules into a static site generator like hugo or hakyll and get going from there.

But for now, other things beckon my time.
